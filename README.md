# List of Bitcoin Open Source Developer Grants

We compiled this list of Bitcoin and Lightning Open Source Developer Grants as an aid to the Bitcoin developer community. We recognize the challenges of developing free and open-source software. Hopefully this list is handy.

Since so much of our industry is built on open source, several organizations offer grants to support its ongoing development. If you're a developer seeking funding—or working on a project that isn't aligned with commercial funding—these grants can be a great way to stay focused on building. We assembled this list using a helpful [bitcointalk post]([https://bitcointalk.org/](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5502452.0)) as a starting point.
